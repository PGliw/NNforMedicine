# Classify the patient based on six symptoms!
### Overview
This is a project for university classes. Deep Feed forward neural network was chosen as the classifier model.  
Topic: Computer aided diagnosis of acute urinary tract inflammation with
using artificial neural networks.
Subject: *Application of Informatics in Medicine*.
___
### Goals
* implement a neural network for illness classification,
* make feature ranking using *Kolmogorov-Smirnov* test,
* plan and run experiments to find the best neural-network parameters for this task.
___
### Dataset:
You can find the original dataset [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Acute+Inflammations?fbclid=IwAR1w8M3Jx9TkRmpxOqvlYsWwc5Ry5wi3ZFjCMjRNSBcSGbT-2moukDC5npw "Original dataset").  
It was converted to .csv file to before feeding the neural network.  
Take a look at *diagnosis01dots.csv* file.
___
### Technologies:
* Keras,
* Tensorflow.
___
### Results
There are 8 experiments.   
Each experiment is placed in exp_*???*.py file, where "*???*" stands for name of experiment.  
The results of each experiment are:
* history of learning chart - comprasion of different parameters,
* .csv file with avarage accuracy for each parameter,
* confusion matrix for each tested parameter.  

Jut run one of the exp_*???*.py scripts to find out!
